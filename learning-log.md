### JavaScript ES6 Object & Array Destructuring

Completed:
- Practiced array destructuring to extract multiple objects from a dataset
- Used object destructuring to access properties like `model` and nested objects
- Destructured nested objects such as `speedStats.topSpeed`
- Applied variable aliasing during destructuring to avoid name collisions
- Extracted array elements directly using destructuring (top colour by popularity)
- Improved understanding of real-world data extraction patterns used in React apps

Key Takeaway:
Destructuring makes code cleaner and more readable, especially when working with complex objects and API-style data.
