# JavaScript ES6 Object & Array Destructuring Practice

This project focuses on practicing **ES6 object and array destructuring**, including nested data structures and variable aliasing.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- Array destructuring
- Object destructuring
- Nested object destructuring
- Array element extraction
- Variable renaming (aliasing) during destructuring
- Handling name conflicts in destructured values

## 🧪 Project Overview
A dataset of car objects is used to:
- Extract car models
- Get the most popular colour for each car
- Access nested speed statistics like top speed
- Rename destructured properties to avoid conflicts

This mirrors real-world scenarios such as working with API responses in React applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
